Modules:

The code is organized into different modules, each responsible for provisioning specific resources within the AWS infrastructure. These modules include EC2 instances, security groups, SSH key pairs, and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
EC2 Instances (main.tf):

The aws_instance resource is defined to create EC2 instances. It takes inputs like AMI ID, instance type, key name, security groups, and subnet IDs from variables.
Security Groups (main.tf):

The aws_security_group resource is defined to create security groups. It dynamically allows or denies ingress and egress traffic based on provided port configurations and CIDR blocks.
SSH Key Pair (main.tf):

The aws_key_pair resource is defined to create SSH key pairs for EC2 instances.
VPC (main.tf):

The code creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associated resources such as subnets, internet gateways, NAT gateways, route tables, and route table associations. It also configures public and private subnets.
Outputs (output.tf):

The output blocks define values to be displayed after the infrastructure is deployed, such as subnet IDs and VPC IDs.
Variables (variables.tf):

This file defines various input variables that can be customized when deploying the infrastructure, such as AMI IDs, instance types, key names, CIDR blocks, and more.
Terraform Providers (providers.tf):

The code specifies the required AWS provider version.
Terraform Module Usage:

The main Terraform configuration file (main.tf) uses these modules to deploy specific infrastructure components for web, app, and database tiers. Each module is configured with specific inputs (variables) to customize the resource creation.
Variable Definitions (TFVARS):

The dev.tfvars file provides specific values for the input variables, customizing the infrastructure for different tiers (web, app, db, etc.).
